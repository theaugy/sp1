# SP1 for Mixxx

This script seeks to mimic the main behavior of the Pioneer DDJ-SP1 under Serato,
but with some choice behavior modifications to make it a little better for DJ'ing
without turntables.

#### TODO

    *   Find use for the Slicer and Sampler pad modes

    *   Features in README.md

    *   What to do with middle sampler volume slider? Control the last deck (3 or 4) that you loaded?

    *   Check for updates for autoloop rotary btn bug (deck3 sends same midi as deck4)

    *   Shift+fx1/fx2 functionality?
